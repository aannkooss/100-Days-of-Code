# ProgrammingAssignment5

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to:
1.	Provide students with continued practice creating **functions**
2.  Familiarize students with **passing** variables **by address**.
### Important Notes:
1.	**Formatting**: Make sure that you follow the precise recommendations for the output content and formatting. For your testing purposes, the autograder will be comparing your output to that of the example executable.
2.	**Comments**: Header comments are required on all files and recommended for the rest of the program. Points will be deducted if no header comments are included.
3.	**Filename**: Save your program as ```complex_numbers.c```

## Program
Things are getting complex!  

We're going to build a complex number calculator to perform some simple arithmetic.   

The user should be prompted for an arithmetic operation then two complex numbers, one for the left side of the arithmetic operation and the other for the right side. The resulting complex number should be displayed to the screen.  

For more information on complex numbers, you can check out this website: https://mathbitsnotebook.com/Algebra2/ComplexNumbers/CPArithmeticASM.html

## Requirements
Aside from the main function, your program should include at least **5** additional functions. These functions should follow the best practices discussed during lecture. 

Additionally, at least **4** of your functions should depend on **pass**ing some variables **by address**.

### Example Program Execution
***These are just a few example of how the program should run. Your program should be able to handle any input that is entered in the correct format.***

## Submission details
To submit your project, you will have to use git on a lab computer or your VirtualBox installation:
1.	After accepting the assignment invitation, copy the clone URL
2.	Type 
```git clone clone URL```
3.	cd into your new assignment directory
4.	After working on your files
5.	When you’re ready, type the following commands: 
```
git add .
git commit -m “your commit message”
git push
```
## Academic Honesty
Academic dishonesty is against university as well as the system community standards. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, the following:
Plagiarism: defined as submitting the language, ideas, thoughts or work of another as one's own; or assisting in the act of plagiarism by allowing one's work to be used in this fashion.
Cheating: defined as (1) obtaining or providing unauthorized information during an examination through verbal, visual or unauthorized use of books, notes, text and other materials; (2) obtaining or providing information concerning all or part of an examination prior to that examination; (3) taking an examination for another student, or arranging for another person to take an exam in one's place; (4) altering or changing test answers after submittal for grading, grades after grades have been awarded, or other academic records once these are official.
Cheating, plagiarism or otherwise obtaining grades under false pretenses constitute academic
dishonesty according to the code of this university. Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated and
penalties can include cancelling a student’s enrolment without a grade, giving an F for the course, or for the assignment. For more details, see the University of Nevada, Reno General Catalog.

# ProgrammingAssignment4

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to:
1.	Familiarize students with **functions**
2.  Provide students with continued practice with **expressions**
3.  Provide students with continued practice with **selection**
4.  Provide students with continued practice with **looping**
### Important Notes:
1.	**Formatting**: Make sure that you follow the precise recommendations for the output content and formatting. For your testing purposes, the autograder will be comparing your output to that of the example executable.
2.	**Comments**: Header comments are required on all files and recommended for the rest of the program. Points will be deducted if no header comments are included.
3.	**Filename**: Save your program as ```menu_functions.c```

## Program
Loop de Loop but make it Functional!  

**The program should behave as follows:**  
- the (N)umbers option should let the user enter numbers until they enter a 0. They should be told how many digits are in their number.
- the (D)raw option should let the user enter a size for the triangle that the program will draw.
- the e(X)it option should quit the program.

The menu should continue to be displayed until the user quits the program. Any other option should result in an error message (but the program should continue).

### Requirements
Aside from the main function, your program should include at least **3** additional functions. These functions should follow the best practices discussed during lecture. 

Your program should include *at least* one of each type of loop.  

### Example Program Execution:
***These are just a few example of how the program should run. Your program should be able to handle any input that is entered in the correct format.***

## Submission details
To submit your project, you will have to use git on your VirtualBox installation:
1.	After accepting the assignment invitation, copy the clone URL
2.	Type 
```git clone clone URL```
3.	cd into your new assignment directory
4.	After working on your files
5.	When you’re ready, type the following commands: 
```

git commit -m “your commit message”
git push
```
## Academic Honesty
Academic dishonesty is against university as well as the system community standards. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, the following:
Plagiarism: defined as submitting the language, ideas, thoughts or work of another as one's own; or assisting in the act of plagiarism by allowing one's work to be used in this fashion.
Cheating: defined as (1) obtaining or providing unauthorized information during an examination through verbal, visual or unauthorized use of books, notes, text and other materials; (2) obtaining or providing information concerning all or part of an examination prior to that examination; (3) taking an examination for another student, or arranging for another person to take an exam in one's place; (4) altering or changing test answers after submittal for grading, grades after grades have been awarded, or other academic records once these are official.
Cheating, plagiarism or otherwise obtaining grades under false pretenses constitute academic dishonesty according to the code of this university. Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated and penalties can include cancelling a student’s enrollment without a grade, giving an F for the course, or for the assignment. For more details, see the University of Nevada, Reno General Catalog.

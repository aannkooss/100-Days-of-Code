Goals of today:

To accomplish file manipulation and file I/O

First we started with learning how to open files and access different read and write mode.
- We then worked on adding a high score functionality to the snake game by adding high scores to a list  
  and then getting that highest number so that the high score is always accurate

- Some things to take note of  
 `../Directory` is used for going traversing backwards through a directory  
 
There are various modes such as  
  - "w": write, replaces text in a file 
  - "a" append, adds to the text in a file 
  - "r': read, set to this by default but stores and collects data in file
